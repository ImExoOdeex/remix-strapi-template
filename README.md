# **Remix Strapi Template**

Hi, this is my Strapi template for [Remix](https://remix.run). It's a simple content managment system used with remix to allow your clients edit the content of their website. It contains index single type and it's read in `_index.tsx`'s loader in your remix index route. You will need to run two apps at once to make it work.
